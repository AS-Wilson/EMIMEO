\paragraph{Modes \linebreak}
The modes of light in a fibre correspond to the solutions that can be found to Maxwell's field equations for the distribution of the electric and magnetic fields within the fibre. \linebreak

Once we obtain a differential equation which describes the EM field's components it's surface is able to be solved by using the bessel functions (which are particularly applicable to the components of cylindrically shaped phenomena in engineering in general). Unless weakly guided, each mode will be described by a given bessel function??

\paragraph{The propagation constant, $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ \linebreak}
Firstly, please note this is sometimes (extremely confusingly) referred to as the wavenumber in some textbooks (and vice-versa, the wavenumber is called the propagation constant). However, in the case of these notes this will always be the propagation constant (with the wavenumber being something else entirely, described in these notes elsewhere, and denoted $k$). measured in $m^{-1}$

Denoted $\beta$ 

each mode will result in a different solution to it's propagation constant (sometimes called a wavenumber in textbooks),

%%%%% TUTORIAL ONE %%%%%
\subsection{Tutorial One - Propagation of LP Modes in Step Index Fibres}
%%%%% QUESTION ONE %%%%%
\subsubsection{Question One}
\textit{Step index fibres are constituted by a cylindrical core refractive index n\textsubscript{1}($\lambda$), surrounded by a cladding refractive index n\textsubscript{2}($\lambda$). Most of the time, the cladding is masde of pure silica and the core is made of silica doped with germanium.} \\


\paragraph{Part A \linebreak}
\textit{What is the meaning of the expression ``Step Index''?} \linebreak


%% Set the left/right column width ratio to 6:4.
\columnratio{0.6}

%%%%%%%%%% LEFT HAND COLUMN %%%%%%%%%%
% Start a 2-column paracol. Both the left and right columns will automatically
% break across pages if things get too long.
\begin{paracol}{2}

``Step Index'' refers to the refractive index profile of the core and the difference between the core and cladding refractive indices (usually denoted $n_1$ and $n_2$ respectively). In a step index fibre the index of the core remains constant through it's radius and then the refractive index value ``steps'' immediately at the cladding.

Figure \ref{fig:fibre_index_profile} shows the cross section of a step index fibre (on the left of the image) and a graph plotting refractive index versus cross-sectional radius, the x-axis represents the refractive index as it varies against the radius of the cross section (represented by the y-axis).

    \label{fig:fibre_index_profile}
\end{figure}

\end{paracol}




\paragraph{Part B \linebreak}
\textit{What is the role of germanium in the core?} \linebreak

Germanium is one of a myriad of available materials that are used to change the refractive index of silica to desirable values. Making the silica in the core of an optical fibre slightly impure results in an increase of the core's refractive index which results in light being able to propagate through the core due to the difference between the core and cladding refractive indices.




\paragraph{Part C \linebreak}
\textit{In what range of wavelengths are optical fibres used for telecommunication systems? Why?} \linebreak

\emph{Simple / Short Answer:} \linebreak
The range of wavelengths used in optical communications is between 850nm - 1675nm. The reason for this particular range is due to the suitably low attenuation and dispersion characteristics at these wavelengths in silica fibre. \linebreak

\emph{Detailed / Long Answer:} \linebreak
For a number of reason, there are a lot of nuances in the answer to this question. The first optical fibres operated in a band with a centre wavelength around 850-870nm \cite{fund_of_photonics}\cite{adv_fiber_optics} where efficient enough light sources and detectors were available, and only for short distance as the loss was ~4 dB/km. \cite{adv_fiber_optics} \linebreak

\newpage

However, since the development of these original telecommunications systems optical fibre technologies have advanced significantly and there is a range of frequencies which are considered to be within the practical application window for modern optical fibres. Sources differ and as such listed below are the frequencies reported to be used (and which sources report them):

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm]
	\item 1265nm - 1675nm (EMIMEO course notes: Linear Propagation in Optical Fibres, Chapter One)
	\item 1260nm - 1675nm \cite{fund_of_photonics}
	\item 1250nm - 1650nm: Additionally specified that most modern telecommunications are only conducted on the C-Band (1530-1565nm), L-Band (1565-1625nm), with the use of Raman amplification this is extended to the E\&S bands (1360-1463nm, 1460-1530nm), and originally the O-Band was used (1260-1360nm) \cite{adv_fiber_optics}
\end{itemize}


Regardless of which exact values are stated in the various sources (they are all roughly the same), specifying a range of realistic wavelengths for the propagation of light down an optical fibre is necessary for a number of reasons, these being: \linebreak

The attenuation (a coefficient given the symbol $\alpha$ and measured in dB/Km) is at it's lowest across this range of values, allowing propagation of light without over-degradation of signal. Across the range of frequencies the attenuation is in the range of 0.3 - ~1 dB/Km with a significant dip at ~1550nm). And; \linebreak

The dispersion characteristics ($D_{\lambda}$, ps/Km-nm), which is the the mount of spread (change in period) of a pulse as it propagates down a fibre, are most desirable in this range. 
Dispersion is considered to be chromatic dispersion (dispersion of light differs with wavelength) which is made of two components material dispersion and waveguide dispersion (with the latter held as being larger than the former \cite{fund_of_photonics}). The equations used to calculate dispersion is shown in Equations \ref{eqn:dispersion} \& \ref{eqn:dispersion_mat_wg}:

\subsubsection{Question Two}
\textit{A manufacturer of silica fibres receives an order for a step index fibre which must fulfil the three following conditions:}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm, label={\textit{\bfseries C\arabic*:}}]
	\item \textit{The numerical aperture, which is assumed to be independent of the wavelength, must be 0.12 (i.e. $NA=0.12$)}
	\item \textit{The fibre must be single mode @ $\lambda = 800 nm$}
	\item \textit{The fibre must be able to guide at least two LP modes @  $\lambda = 750 nm$}
\end{enumerate}

%\textit{The second half of this question could be better stated as ``What kind of degenerated transverse modes can be considered in this case?''}

\textit{Part b - What are the two fibres that fulfil the condition C1?} \linebreak


Using Equations \ref{eqn:num_aper} - \ref{eqn:normalised} and assuming $n_{clad}$ is approximately 1.453 the values for the Numerical Aperture (NA), the Fraction Refractive Index Difference ($\Delta$), and Normalised Spatial Frequency (V) can be calculated as shown in Table \ref{tab:fibre_calculations}.

The weak guidance approximation / limit states that as long as the refractive index of the core ($n_{core}$) is close enough to that of the cladding ($n_{clad}$) such that the fractional refractive index difference ($\Delta$) is less that 0.001 ($\Delta \leq 10^{-2}$), this means that from the values calculated in Table \ref{tab:fibre_calculations} the weak guidance approximation may be used with all the fibres. \linebreak
As the weak guidance approximation applies, only Linearly Polarized (LP) modes can propagate.\linebreak

Finally, only two fibres will meet the requirement of condition C1 (The numerical aperture must be 0.12 i.e. $NA=0.12$), namely fibres 2 \& 3 \linebreak




\paragraph{Part C \linebreak}
\textit{Determine the limit values of the diameter of the core (maximal value and minimal value) imposed by the conditions C2 and C3. Deduce that the Fibre 3 only fulfils all the conditions required by the customer.} \linebreak

\medskip

From the graph showing the dispersion curves of LP modes (made using the bessel functions) it can be seen that in order to be single mode @ 800nm the V parameter of any fibre at this wavelength must be less than 2.405. In this same vein of thinking in order to propagate more than one mode @ 750nm the V parameter at this wavelength must be more than 2.405. \linebreak


These new conditions are stated mathematically in Equation \ref{eqn:new_conditions}, additionally, rearranging Equation \ref{eqn:normalised} to find suitable radius' will result in Equation \ref{eqn:radius_rearr}, and solving for our two conditions will give us a range of core radius' equal to Equation \ref{eqn:dia_calc} ($\py{d_min} < \text{ diameter, \o } < \py{d_max}$). \linebreak

		a > \frac{2.405 \cdot \lambda_{750}}{2\pi \cdot NA} \implies &a < \frac{2.405 \cdot (750 \times 10^{-9})}{2\pi \cdot 0.12}\nonumber\\\

Finally, from the previous part of the question we know that the only fibres which fulfil condition C1 are fibres 3 and 4 (thus they will satisfy the NA requirement, which was assumed in the equations). Also, since we have just calculated that fibre 4 does not meet the radius requirements inferred by conditions C1 and C2, it can be stated that only fibre 3 meets all three conditions.

\medskip

Calculating in much the same way as before, and fully demonstrated in Equation \ref{eqn:v_fib_3_a}, the V parameter of fibre 3 at the wavelength of 457nm is \py{NSF_3A}. Consulting the dispersion curve indicates that 4 LP modes will propagate, $LP_{01}$, $LP_{11}$, $LP_{21}$ and  $LP_{02}$.

\paragraph{Part B \linebreak}
\textit{Sketch a schematic representation of the energy distribution in each of these modes.} \linebreak

The relevant LP modes' energy distributions have been fully graphed in three dimensions as shown below in Figure \ref{fig:lp_modes}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\scalebox{0.4}{\input{./Graphs/3d-charge-distribution-LP01-mode.pgf}}
	
    \caption{\centering{3D Graphs of the LP modes present in fibre 3 at a wavelength of 457nm.}}

    \label{fig:lp_modes}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Part C \linebreak}
\textit{With any injection conditions, what can we observe on a screen set in front of the output face of the fibre?} \linebreak

If one were to attempt to look at the end of fibre 3 the superposition of all the energy distributions from each LP mode would be seen, with an unknown phase relation, as well as a weight to each distribution which , whilst unknown, would be dependent on the mode coupling along the propagation axis. This would result in what is known as a ``speckle'' with large, unknown grains of energy distribution



\paragraph{Part D \linebreak}
\textit{Fibre 3 is spliced to a fibre $F_M$, single mode @ $\lambda_A$ and one measures the power at the output of this second fibre. What do we note if we handle the Fibre 3? Justify your answer. What do we note if we handle the Fibre $F_M$, without touching Fibre 3? Justify your answer.} \linebreak

Whenever fibre three is twisted and bent, its output energy distribution (the speckle originally seen) will change in an unknown way, it will remain as a speckle but the shapes within the speckle will be different. However, since the only mode which can propagate along the fibre $F_{M}$ is the $LP_{01}$ mode, the only energy that can propagate from fibre 3 into fibre $F_{M}$ will have to be that of the $LP_{01}$ mode. This means that at the output of the fibre $F_{M}$ the $LP_{01}$ mode will be seen with fluctuations in the energy levels as more or less energy from the various modes found in fibre 3 are able to propagate due to changes in the shape and propagation axis of the fibre during mechanical manipulation. \linebreak

If only fibre $F_{M}$ is bent and twisted, as long as the manipulations are not overly excessive, the same $LP_{01}$ mode energy distribution will remain, with very little or no change in the energy distribution in the fibre. If the manipulations are too excessive there may be some losses in the signal.


\newpage




\subsubsection{Question Four}
\textit{We now work with the Fibre 3 only (Fibre $F_M$ is removed), @ $\lambda_T = 800nm$.}




\paragraph{Part A \linebreak}
\textit{Using the provided information, evaluate the propagation constant, $\beta$, of the fundamental LP mode @ $\lambda_T$.} \linebreak

From the previous calculations, it is known that fibre 3 has a ``V'' parameter of \py{NSF[3]}, consulting the dispersion curve at this point shows that the fibre is in single mode ($LP_{01}$) and will have a normalised propagation constant (B) value of approx. \py{fibre_3_B}. \linebreak
To obtain a relationship between the normalised propagation constant and the propagation constant ($\beta$) of a given mode, Equation \ref{eqn:normal_prop_k} is rearranged as shown to produce Equation \ref{eqn:beta_rearr}; then the relevant values are substituted into this equation to produce the value shown in Equation \ref{eqn:f3_k_of_prop} (\py{f3_beta} $\times 10^6 \text{ } m^{-1}$).

		\text{Rearranging for propagation constant:} \nonumber\\
		\implies B \cdot NA^2 = \frac{\beta^2 - k_0^2 \cdot n_{clad}^2}{k_0^2}\nonumber\\
		\implies B \cdot NA^2 = \frac{\beta^2}{k_0^2} -\frac{k_0^2 \cdot n_{clad}^2}{k_0^2} = \frac{\beta^2}{k_0^2} -n_{clad}^2\nonumber\\
		\implies B \cdot NA^2 + n_{clad}^2 = \frac{\beta^2}{k_0^2} \nonumber\\
