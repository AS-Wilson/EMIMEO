\section*{Explanation and Introduction of this Document}
This is my exam revision document for the Quantum Technologies module. I used this to ensure I have revised everything required for the exam, additionally it is a good reference document for which equations and processes (of questions/exercises) one should memorize to ensure they are completely ready for the exam. \linebreak
The exam format, of course, changes from year to year, but it is highly likely you will be asked questions as below. Note that usually the total number of marks is more than 10; this is so that you can still obtain a good mark despite unseen questions.\linebreak
In any case, I have uploaded past papers to the \textit{\textbf{EMIMEO}} repo. on \href{https://github.com/AS-Wilson}{my github}, this should serve as good exam practice and reference material. \linebreak
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1cm]
	\item \textbf{Two} theory questions, eg's:
	\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5cm]
		\item Demonstrate how to derive the reflectivity and transmission coefficients
		\item Derive the equations related to Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Three or Four} Homework Questions (of course with some variation in numbers, values, etc.)
	\item \textbf{Two} New questions or tasks OR somewhat complex variations to already seen derivations or homework questions
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.25cm}

Hopefully the advice and information contained within this document and my ``notes'' file serves you well and that you will succeed in the Q.T. exam! \linebreak

Sincerly,\linebreak

\hspace{1cm}\textit{Andrew Simon Wilson}
%I wrote this document for the students studying Quantum Technologies to have a nice handout set for the important definitions involved in the course. I hope that it is sufficient for this task and it helps all of your studies. \linebreak
%I spent have spent a lot of time developing the template used to make this {\LaTeX} document, I want others to benefit from this work so the source code for this template is available on GitHub \cite{latex_template_github}.
