%%%%% INTRO %%%%%
\section*{Explanation and Introduction of this Document}
I wrote this document for the students studying Quantum Technologies to have a nice handout set for the important definitions involved in the course. I hope that it is sufficient for this task and it helps all of your studies. \linebreak
I spent have spent a lot of time developing the template used to make this {\LaTeX} document, I want others to benefit from this work so the source code for this template is available on GitHub \cite{latex_template_github}.
