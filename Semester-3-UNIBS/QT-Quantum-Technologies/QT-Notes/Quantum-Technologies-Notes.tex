	\section*{Explanation and Introduction of this Document}
		
		I wrote this document for the students studying Quantum Technologies to have a nice set of notes, and correct reference code and graphs for the module. I hope that it is sufficient for this task and it helps all of your studies. \linebreak
		I spent have spent a lot of time developing the template used to make this {\LaTeX} document, I want others to benefit from this work so the source code for this template is available on GitHub \cite{latex_template_github}.
